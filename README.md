# Cyber Music Studio™

*Not your usual DAW. Work in progress.*

This will be self-contained browser-based music making program. 

It's not finished yet, but you can try [individual instruments](https://severak.github.io/cyber-music-studio/). Some of these instruments now support [WebMidiLink](https://www.g200kg.com/en/docs/webmidilink/index.html).

Based on custom library called [heartbeat.js](js/heartbeat.md) which is developed alongside this project (in this repo).

Also it uses custom javascript library and CSS framework (both called `uboot`) and following third party libraries (all of which are included in this repo): 

- [JZZ.js](https://github.com/jazz-soft/JZZ) for MIDI connectivity and keyboard widget
- [Audio Recorder Polyfill](https://github.com/ai/audio-recorder-polyfill) for WAV recording
- [Wavy Jones](https://github.com/stuartmemo/wavy-jones) oscilloscope
- cliparts from [OpenClipArt](https://openclipart.org/) and textures from [3D Jugle](https://3djungle.net/textures/)

Created by [Severák](http://tilde.town/~severak/) since 2021.

Thanks for all the fish.
